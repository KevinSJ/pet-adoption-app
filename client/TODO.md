1. Create a React app in this folder, just like how we did in other labs. Rename the package to indicate this is for front end 
2. Think about the components you want to create and start creating components
    Example structure:
      - components
        - navbar
        - page
        - pet
        - petListings
3. Build the components, linking each other if necessary. Adding styles as you see fit.
4. IF you haven't build the back end, then start with displaying the listings from the example JSON file in the example-data folder.
5. Or if you prefer, you can start building the back end now
6. After you have finished the backend, start connecting the frontend with the backend and fetching data from the backend
